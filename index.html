		Getting Started with Microsoft Powershell . <br> </br>
This Microsoft PowerShell course is designed to teach IT professionals, admins, and help desk personnel about how to use PowerShell to improve management capabilities, automate redundant tasks, and manage the environment in scale. Through this PowerShell tutorial, I learned how PowerShell works and how to make PowerShell work for me as an IT professional. The course is taught by Jeffrey Snover, the inventor of PowerShell, and Jason Helmick, Senior Technologist at Concentrated Technology. <br> </br>

Additionally, I learned about extending the shell and how to find and add snap-ins, modules and commands. <br> </br>
The fourth section is ‘Objects for the Admin’ - This module reviews objects across the pipeline and how to get the information you need. I learned about sorting and selecting objects, custom properties and filtering data, and what methods to use when no cmdlet exists. <br> </br>

It shows you how to turn your script into a tool for others and store your tools in a module. <br> </br>

Getting Started with PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)  <br> </br>
PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC) is one of the fastest-moving technologies today. But more than that, it literally transforms how IT Implementers deploy and manage on-premises resources and those extended to hybrid and other cloud environments for both Windows and Linux. <br> </br>
The first section is ‘Getting ready for DSC] - Gave an overview of the architecture, along with resources and requirements for DSC. <br> </br>

The second section is ‘Performing a Push deployment’ - Performed a push deployment configuring the LCM and first DSC configuration. <br> </br>

The third section is ‘Configuring Pull Servers for Deployment’ - Explore the pull server options, SMB and HTTP. <br> </br>

The fourth section is ‘Deploying Configurations Using a Pull Server’ – I learned to prepare an environment for pull configurations and to query diagnostic information. <br> </br>

The fifth section is ‘Resource roundup’ – Learned how to work with the available resources in your configurations. <br> </br>
